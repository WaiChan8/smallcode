// SmallCode — Clarification Loop
// Detects vague/ambiguous prompts and asks the user for clarification
// before wasting tool calls on a misunderstood task.
//
// Triggers ONLY when:
// - Prompt matches a specific vague pattern (not just being short)
// - Multiple interpretations are genuinely possible
// - The last assistant message did NOT end with a question (context-aware guard
//   lives in smallcode.js — if the assistant asked a question, the user's reply
//   is an answer, not a new task, regardless of how short it is)
//
// Does NOT trigger on:
// - Short but actionable commands ("run tests", "fix bug", "add logging")
// - Greetings ("hi", "hello") — model should respond naturally
// - Confirmations ("yes", "no", "ok") — these answer the model's questions
// - Multi-word follow-ups ("go ahead", "read it") — continuation phrases
// - Multi-number selections ("1 and 2") — answering a numbered list
